uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
Rust. While all programs have been implemented, some options might be missing or
different behavior might be experienced.

uutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, Mac, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.
