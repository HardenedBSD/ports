niri is a scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor inspired by PaperWM.
Windows are tiled on an infinite horizontal strip that scrolls left
and right. They don't "overflow" onto adjacent monitors. Opening a new
window never resizes existing ones.

Features:
- Scrollable tiling
- Dynamic workspaces like in GNOME
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
- Touchpad gesture to switch workspaces
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- Live-reloading config
